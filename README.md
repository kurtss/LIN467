Kansai-ben word detector

Japan is a country that is filled with many dialects. One specifically worth noting is the Kansai dialect, also referred to by other names such as the Osaka dialect, Kinki dialect, et cetera. This dialect is noteworthy due to its amount of verb conjugations that differ greatly from standard Japanese, as well as lexical entries that are also different. This project attempts to detect these non-standard words or dialectal words automatically, and replace them with an appropriate standard form.
